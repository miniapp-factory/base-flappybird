#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create a new file that describes the logo you want to generate.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to create a new file for the logo description. Please add the following file to the chat:

```

```

Once that file is added, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for updating `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and for creating the logo description.

A stylized, vibrant illustration of a bird in mid‑flight against a gradient sky background. The bird is rendered in a modern, slightly cartoonish style with a subtle Base blockchain motif (a faint hexagonal pattern) in the lower right corner. The composition conveys motion and excitement, reflecting the Flappy Bird gameplay, while the Base logo element hints at the blockchain integration. The image should be eye‑catching and suitable for use as the app’s primary logo.

The changes you’re asking for will touch the following files in your repository.  
Please add each of these files to the chat (by pasting their current contents) so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

```
mini-app/lib/constants.ts          # holds the GMMC token address and reward‑pool config

mini-app/app/.well-known/farcaster.json/route.ts
mini-app/app/page.tsx              # for the <meta name="base:app_id"> tag
```

Once you provide these files, I’ll supply the precise *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks to implement the on‑chain reward pool, token integration, authentication, and domain update.

The following files in your repository will need to be edited to implement the on‑chain reward pool, token integration, authentication, and domain update:

```
mini-app/lib/constants.ts
mini-app/lib/contracts.ts
mini-app/components/auth.tsx
mini-app/lib/metadata.ts
mini-app/app/.well-known/erc721.json/route.ts
mini-app/app/.well-known/farcaster.json/route.ts
mini-app/app/page.tsx
```

Please add the current contents of each of these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need the current contents of the following files that are part of the new “gmmc‑daily‑attestation” structure so I can create the appropriate *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

```
contracts/DailyCheckInAttestation.sol
scripts/deploy-base.ts
scripts/fund-rewards.ts
frontend/app/api/frame/route.ts
frontend/app/api/frame/checkin/route.ts
frontend/app/api/frame/confirm/route.ts
frontend/app/profile/page.tsx
frontend/components/CheckInButton.tsx
frontend/components/WalletConnect.tsx
frontend/public/frame.png
frontend/public/success.png
frontend/thirdweb.ts
hardhat.config.ts
.env.example
whitepaper.md
```

Once you add those files to the chat, I’ll provide the changes for `mini-app/package.json`, `mini-app/app/page.tsx`, `mini-app/app/layout.tsx`, and `README.md` to match the new structure.
